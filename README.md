# Instagram-UserId

Find Instagram User's Id using Python

Well, I know there are lots of Github repo currently present, which allow you to find user id of the Instagram User.
If I'm not wrong, then, most of the repo based on this, use Instagram API.

A little bit of Inspect Element, and it helped me to find user id of the Instagram User using using their API.

So, when I say "we won't use API", it means we are not going to use api in our code.

Now, How it worked ?

Solution : Read it from here : <a href="http://rishicodes.wordpress.com/"> Rishi Giri </a> 

PS: I've  not written the blog for this code, as it's quite easy to understand what the code do.

But, I'll write it in future.
